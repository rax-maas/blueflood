## Introduction

Blueflood is a multi-tenant, distributed metric processing system. Blueflood is capable of ingesting, rolling up and serving metrics at a massive scale.  

## Getting Started

The latest code will always be here on Github.

    git clone https://github.com/rax-maas/blueflood.git
    cd blueflood

## Building

Blueflood builds and runs on Java 8. Ensure you're using an appropriate JDK before proceeding.

Blueflood builds with Maven. Use typical Maven lifecycle phases:

- `mvn clean` removes build artifacts.
- `mvn test` runs unit tests.
- `mvn verify` runs all tests.
- `mvn package` builds a Blueflood package for release.

Important build profiles to know about:

- `skip-unit-tests` skips unit tests in all modules.
- `skip-integration-tests` skips the integration tests.

Blueflood's main artifact is an ['uber jar'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11947037/what-is-an-uber-jar), produced
by the [`blueflood-all` module](blueflood-all/pom.xml).

### Running

You can easily build a ready-to-run Blueflood jar from source:

    mvn package -P skip-unit-tests,skip-integration-tests

However, it requires Cassandra to start and Elasticsearch for all its features to work. The best place to start is the
[10 minute guide](https://github.com/rackerlabs/blueflood/wiki/10-Minute-Guide).

## Additional Tools

The Blueflood team maintains a number of tools that are related to the project, but not essential components of it.
These tools are kept in various other repos:

* Performance Tests: Scripts for load testing a blueflood installation using [The
  Grinder](http://grinder.sourceforge.net/). https://github.com/rackerlabs/raxmetrics-perf-test-scripts

* Carbon Forwarder: a process that receives data from carbon (one of the components of
  [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/)) and sends it to a Blueflood instance.
  https://github.com/rackerlabs/blueflood-carbon-forwarder

* Blueflood-Finder: a plugin for graphite-web and graphite-api that allows them to using a Blueflood instance as a data
  backend. https://github.com/rackerlabs/blueflood-graphite-finder

* StatsD plugin: a statsD backend that sends metrics a Blueflood instance.
