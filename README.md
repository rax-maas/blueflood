## Introduction

Blueflood is a multi-tenant, distributed metric processing system. Blueflood is capable of ingesting, rolling up and serving metrics at a massive scale.  

## Getting Started

The latest code will always be here on Github.

    git clone https://github.com/rackerlabs/blueflood.git
    cd blueflood
    
You can run the entire suite of tests using Maven:

    mvn test integration-test

### Building

Build an ['uber jar'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11947037/what-is-an-uber-jar) using maven:

    mvn package -P all-modules

The uber jar will be found in ${BLUEFLOOD_DIR}/blueflood-all/target/blueflood-all-${VERSION}-jar-with-dependencies.jar.
This jar contains all the dependencies necessary to run Blueflood with a very simple classpath.

### Running

The best place to start is the [10 minute guide](https://github.com/rackerlabs/blueflood/wiki/10minuteguide).
In a nutshell, you must do this:

    java -cp /path/to/uber.jar \
    -Dblueflood.config=file:///path/to/blueflood.conf \
    -Dlog4j.configuration=file:///path/to/log4j.properties \
    com.rackspacecloud.blueflood.service.BluefloodServiceStarter
    
Each configuration option can be found in Configuration.java.  Each of those can be overridden on the command line by
doing:

    -DCONFIG_OPTION=NEW_VALUE
